            <h2>Intro to Wrestling</h2>

            <h3>Freestyle Wrestling</h3>
            <p> Freestyle wrestling, one of three styles of wrestling used in international amateur competition (the others are Greco-Roman wrestling and sambo) under supervision of the Fédération Internationale de Lutte Amateur (International Amateur Wrestling Federation). It was derived from the English Lancashire, or catch-as-catch-can, style, in which nearly all holds were permitted. Freestyle wrestling is also an Olympic event. Women’s competition was added to the Olympic program in 2004.</p>

            <h3>Greco-Roman</h3>
            <p>Greco-Roman wrestling, style of wrestling practiced in Olympic and international amateur competition. In Greco-Roman wrestling the legs may not be used in any way to obtain a fall, and no holds may be taken below the waist. Other rules and procedures for Greco-Roman wrestling are the same as those for freestyle wrestling, the other international amateur style.</p>
